# Exercise Week 1

**Due before class starts Monday, January 29th.**

Get an input using more than two features (at least 3) into Wekinator working. Use the examples found in the [Wekinator Examples repo](https://github.com/artintelclass/wekinator_examples) to get started. You might find some other interesting OSC inputs [here](https://github.com/artintelclass/ml4a-ofx/tree/master/osc-modules).

Using your inputs, train several classifiers in Wekinator. For example, if you're using a Face Tracker, maybe one class is mouth open, maybe another class is mouth closed, etc.

After training, use your input running through Wekinator, sending out OSC to an output. Make different things happen with each of your classes.

Take clear video of it working and post a link to the video somewhere in this repo. Also explain what your input, output, classes, etc. are. Post your code, Wekinator model, etc., here as well.
